# Three.js Journey

## Setup

Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build

# Create and launch a new playground
npm run create <name>

```

## Playgrounds

Are environments to quickly play with threejs.
Launching the command `npm run create mynewplayground` will duplicate the templates/playground folder in the src and start a server located to the proper output path & open visual studio code to the freshly created script.js.
